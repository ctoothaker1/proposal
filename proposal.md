# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

East-bound

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A 2d sidescroller game inspired by super mario bros.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will be a game where the user controls a character and dodges obstacles, enemies, and overall avoid death. The playable character will always head to the right side of the screen, and at a certain score the character will either obtain powerups/health points to continue. It will be an endless scrolling game, and once the player loses all of their health it will display their score. Score is based on time survived and distance traveled. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A playable game, visually pleasing design, and a level of fun similar to the dinosaur game on google. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

scoring that keeps track of the high score, cool animations, a pause menu to restart the game or quit the game.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best possible outcome for my project would contain all of the features I already listed as well as possibly: a diverse set of enemy sprites, more complex level designs adding uncertainty to the game since the level will be randomly generated (different sets of obstacles), and a leaderboard to keep track of high scores. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to figure out how to use a new game development software like unity engine or unreal engine. I'll need to research how to efficiently code my game using one of these engines and how to import sprites/create sprites for enemies and level design.
